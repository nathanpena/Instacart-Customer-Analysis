# Instacart Customer Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis and visualization work for Instacart, focusing on customer profiling, regional spending habits, and marketing strategy insights.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Data Analysis and Enrichment

1. **Data Import and Security**:
    - Imported the merged customer data set from Exercise 4.9 into a Jupyter notebook.
    - Addressed security implications and handled PII data appropriately.

2. **Regional Segmentation**:
    - Created a `Region` column based on the `State` column using geographic information.

3. **Spending Habits Analysis**:
    - Analyzed spending habits across different U.S. regions.

4. **Customer Exclusion**:
    - Created an exclusion flag for low-activity customers (less than 5 orders).

5. **Customer Profiling**:
    - Developed customer profiles based on age, income, department purchases, and other relevant factors.
    - Visualized the distribution of these profiles.

6. **Aggregation and Comparison**:
    - Aggregated usage frequency and expenditure at the customer-profile level.
    - Compared profiles with regions and departments to identify behavioral patterns.

7. **Visualization and Export**:
    - Produced charts to illustrate the results and exported them.

### Part 2: Reporting

1. **Final Report**:
    - Completed a detailed report template with project details, population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling steps, derived columns, visualizations, and results.

2. **Script and Folder Organization**:
    - Tidied up scripts, added contents lists, and organized the project folder for submission.
